            <p class="desc2">Virat Kohli (Hindustani, born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer and
                former captain of the India national cricket team. He plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and Royal
                Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League as a right-handed batsman. He is often considered one
                of the best batsmen of his era and some critics believe him to be one of the best limited-overs batsmen
                in history. Between 2013 and 2022, he captained the India cricket team in 213 matches across all three
                formats. With 40 wins out of 68 test matches, Kohli is the most successful test captain in Indian
                cricket history.
